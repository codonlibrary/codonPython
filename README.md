## What is `codon`?

The `codon` project was created to increase code sharing, consistancy of code and coding standards and encourage collaboration. The repository contains Python, R and SQL code for ease of use in workflows on platforms used within NHS Digital such as Databricks. Everything you need to use the repository should be available on the GitHub pages however further information for NHS Digital staff can be found [here](https://confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CON/Codon+-+Code+sharing), via our internal confluence page. `codonPython` aims to reduce the barrier for entry for analysis and provide software development experience for those at a higher level of technical ability. 

### Why `codon`?

In biological terms, a `codon` is one of the building blocks that make up our DNA. By openly sharing our code we hope that others will be able to take those blocks of code to build their own processes using the data that NHS Digital hold.

By sharing code, the project aims to:

**Increase Transparency**: To align with government data principles and build public trust.

**Improve Code**: To innovate and improve the code we use and provide.

**Improve usability**: By increasing the accessibility and uniformity of code, it becomes easier for data users to find and use relevant code.

**Be more cost effective**: Reusable 'generalised' code will increase efficiency in creating higher level processes.


## Installation 
The package can be directly installed by typing in your terminal: 
```r
python -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython.git
```
For further guidance on cloning from the remote repository to a local repository on your machine see the information in our [Wiki.](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython/wiki/1.-Installing-codonPython)

## Contributing to codonPython
All new contributions to `codon` are welcome; please follow the Coding Conventions in the [guidance document](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidance. 

Any improvements to documentation, bug fixes or general code enhancements are also welcomed. If a bug is found on the master branch, please use the GitHub guidance on raising an [issue.](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)

## New to GitHub?
GitHub is a hosting site that allows for development and version control of software using Git. It allows users to edit and develop parts of code independently before submitting back to the master code, whilst using version control to track changes. Introductory videos to GitHub for beginners can be found [here.](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython/wiki/2a.-GitHub-for-Beginners)
