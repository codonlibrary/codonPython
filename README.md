`codonPython` will reduce the entry barrier for analysis and provide software development experience for those at a higher level of technical ability. 

## What is `codon`?

`Codon` is a project working towards creating a code repository to increase code sharing, consistancy and collaboration. The repository contains Python, R and SQL code for ease of use in workflows on platforms such as data bricks. Further information can be found [here.](https://confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CON/Codon+-+Code+sharing)

### Why `codon`?

**Transparency**: To aline with government data principles and build public trust.

**Improve Code**: To innovate and improve the code we use and provide.

**Usability**: Increase the accessibility and uniformity of code throughout the organisation.

**Cost Effective**: Reusable 'generalised' code will increase efficient in creating higher level processes.


## Instillation 
The package can be directly installed by typing in your terminal: 
```r
python -m pip install --user git+https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython.git
```
For further guidance to clone a local repository to your machine from the remote repository using [GitBash/Command Line.](https://confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CON/Installing+codonPython?flashId=685465781)

## Contributing to codonPython
All new contributions codon are welcome, please follow the Coding Conventions in the [guidance document.](https://github.com/codonlibrary/codonPython/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) for contribution guidance. 
Any improvements to documentaion, bug fixes or general code enhancments are also welcomed. If a bug is found on the master branch please use the GitHub guidance on raising and [issue.](https://help.github.com/en/github/managing-your-work-on-github/creating-an-issue)

## New to GitHub?
GitHub is a hosting site that allows for development and version control of software using Git. It allows users to edit and develop parts of code independently before submitting back to the master code, whilst using version control to track changes. Beginners introductionary videos to GitHub can be found [here.](https://confluence.digital.nhs.uk/display/CON/GitHub+for+beginners) Quick links to begginer guidance can be found below;
